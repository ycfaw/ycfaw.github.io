	<div class="steps">
	<h2>Resume Format</h2>
		<p>The way you organize your resume is incredibly vital to recruiters. It
is imperative that the resume is able to highlight you, usually though an organizational pattern, the most common one being reverse-chronological order, which starts with your current position, usually starts with your abstract information, followed by your experiences (dated), then your education, followed by the courses, skills, and
interests. For entry level jobs, one might prefer to use functional or “skills-based”, which tends to
focus on skills rather than experience to influence recruiters to contact you. Moreover, the actual
text should be used in a text that is easy to read and very professional, such as arial or other
sans-serif fonts. Another way to easily make your resume look more profession is through the
elimination of bullet points.</p>
	<h2>Contact Information</h2>
		<p>The presentation of your contact information is extremely important, as this could greatly affect
whether or not they are going to take you seriously. One of the greatest mistakes one can make
on a resume is the email. Your professional email should not be the same as your personal
email, as it discredits you. It should also be an appropriate. One popular theme that has
come across this century is inputting your social media, as many recruiters may ask for it so make sure your social media accounts are optimized to give your recruiter the best impression of you.</p>
	<h2>Keep Your Recruiter Interested</h2>
		<p>Many recruiters go through thousands of applications a day, and one of the ways to help your application stand out is through a resume summary or objective. These help provide a short synopsis on your experience, or goals and how you plan to help the company in the least amount of words as possible. As a rule of thumb, resume summaries are usually to highlight your career and why you are viable to the company. The resume objective should still highlight your career and why you want to be part of their company, but an objective may be more useful if you are switching careers or not particularly experienced in a career.</p>
	<h2>Specificity</h2>
		<p>Integrating a certain amount of detail is crucial due to the fact that it allows
the recruiter to know you as an individual, instead of another resume letter. One should try to
add as much specificity as possible to their resume so they are not vague and therefore
discredited from their information. An important rule to follow is to always add more to your job
description so the interviewer has a better understanding of why you qualify for the job. Also, if you
have any achievements, being specific about them helps add significance and importance to what you have accomplished. It is better to highlight your accomplishments through specifying when you had been promoted in reverse chronological order. Through this, one is able to show that they are a hard worker and were able to advance in previous companies you have worked for, increasing your chances and image to be able to land an interview.</p>
	<h2>Tailor Your Resume</h2>
		<p>Tailoring your resume to the job that you are applying for is the
best way of being able to land an interview. Considering that most corporate job
offers can receive over 250 resumes, one must make themselves stand out in the face of what
the company is asking you for.</p>
