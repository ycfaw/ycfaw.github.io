  <div id="intro"><h1>Creating a Cover Letter</h1>
	<h4>A cover letter is sent presented with your resume and the purpose of one is to give your potential employer additional information about yourself. It can be your saving grace if your resume isn't very impressive. Keep scrolling to for a guideline to creating one.</h4></div>
	
	<div class="steps">
	<h2>Contact Information</h2>
		<p>Begin by writing your name and contact information, as well as the potential employer's name and contact information. You should also include addresses for both.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Do some research on the company you're sending your resume into and see if you can find the name of the hiring manager and use it in the salutation line. Showing that you've done some homework will make a great impression. Some hiring managers take a salutation that read 'Dear Madam/Sir' or 'To Whom it May Concern' as a sign that you weren't interested enough to study up on the company. Something as small as addressing them directly in a letter can leave a mark.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Next, introduce yourself. Make the beginning eye catching. For example, you can mention something outstanding you did in a previous job, or talk about your passion for the career you're in or trying to get into. The rest of the paragraph should be a description of yourself such as degrees, goals, etc. Keep this paragraph brief.</p>
	<h2>Qualifications</h2>
		<p>Your second paragraph should be about all the things you believe make you're the most qualified for the position you're applying for. You should include skills, abilities, and previous job experience to help show your potential employer what you can bring to the table if hired. See if you can find information on the current state and goals of the company and tell them how you feel you can better it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Stay away from writing statements such as <em>"I am good at..."</em> or <em>"My skills are..."</em> This will not help set you apart from other applicants. You're trying to sell yourself as the best option in a sea of other people who want to do the same thing. You have to stand out. Showcase your personality (without being too informal) and write in a way that lets a hiring manager get to know you, while also proving you have the skills they want. Here is an example:
		<br>"If I’m in a conference room and the video isn’t working, I’m not the sort to simply call IT and wait. I’ll also (gracefully) crawl under the table, and check that everything is properly plugged in."
		
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>In the conclusion, which should also be brief, be sure to let the potential employer you would like to interivewed for the position and that you'll be in contact. Also, be courteous but don't go overboard. Simply writing 'Than you for your time.' will suffice.</p>
	<h2>Tips</h2>
		<p>Choose a font that looks professional and make it an appropriate font. Stay away from going below a font size of 12. Read over your letter before sending it. Make sure your writing is clear and concise and you have no grammatical errors. And remember, there are many templates online for you to follow and make the creation of your cover letter simple and quick.</p>
