  <h1>Aceing Your Interview</h1>
    <h4>So, you've submitted your application and resume and now you've been asked to come in for an interview. Depending on how it goes, you may walk out of their with a new job! But that won't just happen. You need to present yourself in the best way possible. Scroll down to see our pointers on just how to do that.</h4>
  <h2>Meeting Your Interviewer</h2>
		<p>One of the most crucial moments of the entire interview is the connection between you and the interviewer. One should always start with a handshake, as it shows proper interview etiquette.</p>
  <h2>Using Body Language</h2>
		<p>Body language is an incredibly important tactic that could make
or break the opinion the interviewer has of you. Seem open by facing the interviewer, uncrossing your legs and arms, and always having a slight smile on your face. This will help establish confidence and a connection with your interviewer.</p>
<br>
 <p>Nodding along when the interviewer is talking and using your hands to help move your ideas along are usually great, subtle ways to establish credibility and keep from seeming too uptight or stiff.</p>
  <h2>Listening Closely</h2>
	<p>Referring back to what the interviewer had said is a great way to show that not only are you listening to them speak, but you are engaging completely in the conversation with them. For example, if the interviewer had previously spoken about the goal of the company, andlater asks you what you want to achieve if you were hired, you could refer back to the goal of the company and how you could help achieve that goal.</p>
 <h2>Looking at Your Surroundings</h2>
	<p>One of the easiest ways to have a successful interview is to look at the setting where the interview is going to take place. Usually, the room will give clues to what the person is like and what they look for the in the company. The idea is to sell to the interview that you are the person for the job, and by looking at the room one could detect the company’s accomplishments, or even the interviewer’s personal accomplishments. By integrating that into the interview, it could potentially lead the interviewer to associate you with the goal and future of the
company by personalizing the company to yourself, or by associating yourself to your
interviewer.</p>
 <h2>What You Should Be Wearing</h2><img src="https://s20.postimg.org/lgkeul54t/bussman.png" align="left">
	<p>It is said that people for an opinion in the first seven
seconds that they lay their eyes on a person. That being said, the image you portray of
yourself could increase or damage your chances of getting that job. Employers want to see they are hiring someone that has discipline and is serious about what they are doing. Usually, as a rule of thumb, smaller start-up companies are usually
more business casual, whereas for more professional positions one would opt
for business formal. One should always try and appear to be courteous and inviting, as
well as polished. By using color in your outfit, you could add a touch of personality to
your outfit, while still looking professional.
<p>Men can find their happy medium through using lighter color blazer with matching
pants, which is less serious than a dark colored suit, and the option of wearing a tie or
not. Women could also downplay their outfits through the use of lighter colors, such as khaki, grey, or white, although this is usually kept for business casual attire. These colors could help accentuate their outfit while still keeping their professionalism. Bold prints (typically in sweaters) can also be used, but it is best to avoid too bright or flashy patterns, and stick with a two-tone print.</p>

<p>The navy blue blazer is one of the most versatile and breathable articles of clothing for any business event. This blazer could be dressed up or down, for men with a dress shirt and pants for a fresh, but still very professional look. For women, it could be worn with anything from a button down to a dress. One rule to follow when it comes to navy blue blazers is to always match the bottom piece to the blazer.</p>

  <h2>What You Shouldn't Be Wearing</h2>
	<p>When using a blazer or a suit, one must be mindful of the
type of shirt that they use underneath. Women and men alike are to not wear plunging
necklines, see through, or tired shirt. A block colored sweater is a great way to layer
on top of a shirt and under the blazer for a professional look. When dressing yourself, it is important to remember the golden rule: Less is more. Accessories are to be kept to a minimum, usually small things and do not wear sunglasses or flashy necklaces. Also, sometimes too much color could be distracting, so it is best to stick with pastels and softer, more welcoming colors. Also, in terms of ties, if one is unsure about the color, it is best to play it safe and not wear a tie that might make a statement, but stick rather with conservative ones.</p>
