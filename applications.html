	<h4>Your job application is the first impression you will make on your potential employer, so make it count! Below are steps you should take to ensure your job application is done correctly.</h4></div>
	
	<div class="steps">
	<h2>Being Prepared</h2>
		<p>Know the information you made need and know it well. This includes names, dates, locations, and more. In case you are asked to fill out your job application on the spot, it may be a good idea to have a sample application with you so you don't report any incorrect information or forget anything important.</p>
	<h2>Asking for An Application</h2>
		<p>If you are applying for a position in person, ask for an application form to take home. This way you have one that you can take your time filling out and more accurate if you don't have a sample application on you to refer to.</p>
			<h4>TIP: When you apply in person,dress in professional attire.</h4>
	<h2>Having Visibly and Grammatically Clear Writing</h2>
		<p>When you're filling out your application, make sure your writing is legible and grammatically correct. Proofread before you turn in your application and make any corrections. If you're filling out an online application, use a word processor to help with corrections.
			<h4>TIP: Fill out your application in blue or black ink.</h4>
	<h2>Following Instructions</h2>
		<p>This may be common sense but you'd be surprised how many things are done wrong on applications due to an applicant failing to read directions. For online applications, check the website for instructions. For written ones, check the fine print.</p>
	<h2>Being Honest</h2>
		<p>Everything on your application should be the truth. If it is discovered you were not honest about something, it can be a reason for an employer not the hire you, or to terminate your employment if the discrepency is discovered after you are hired. If you feel a part of your application is not impressive, explain them to your interviewer. This will leave a better impression than being dishonest.</p>
	<h2>Being Prepared for A Test</h2>
		<p>The job you're applying for may require you to take a test to help them decided whether or not you are a good fit for their company. You must meet a certain criteria for these jobs so make sure you know your information and are prepared to answer any and all questions asked. You may also be required to take a drug test.</p>	
	<h2>Reviewing Your Application</h2>
		<p>Read through your application before you turn it in and be 100% sure you followed all directions and you have filled out all the sections. Some employers will not hire candidates because their applications are incomplete, so it is very important everything section is done. Write N/A if a section does not apply to you instead of leaving it blank.</p>
